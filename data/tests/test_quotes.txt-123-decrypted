When you come to a fork in the road, take it.

You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I’m not hungry enough to eat six.

You wouldn’t have won if we’d beaten you.

You can observe a lot by just watching.

No one goes there nowadays, it’s too crowded.

Always go to other people’s funerals, otherwise they won’t come to yours.

We made too many wrong mistakes.

Congratulations. I knew the record would stand until it was broken.

It was impossible to get a conversation going, everybody was talking too much.

It gets late early out here.

I never blame myself when I’m not hitting. I just blame the bat and if it keeps up, I change bats. After all, if I know it isn’t my fault that I’m not hitting, how can I get mad at myself?

If you ask me anything I don’t know, I’m not going to answer.

A nickel ain't worth a dime anymore.

People seem to find it hard to believe, but I'm a very serious person. It wasn't luck that I became a ballplayer. I never wanted to be anything else and I never considered anything else and I worked my tail off for it. To say that I don't have any worries or nerves is the opposite of the truth. I worry about not being able to get around on the fast ball any more, I worry about getting hurt and having to quit playing before my time. I worry about the bowling alley I own with Phil Rizzuto making money. I worry about keeping Carm happy so she won't be sorry she married me, about the kids growing up good, and about keeping out of trouble with God. I worry a lot. I'm nobody's mascot, either. Sure, I like to get along with people and I hope I've made friends, but that's different.

[What time is it?] You mean now?
