why are there so many songs about rainbows
and what's on the other side
rainbows are visions
but only illusions
and rainbows have nothing to hide
so we've been told
and some choose to believe it
i know they're wrong, wait and see
some day we'll find it
the rainbow connection
the lovers, the dreamers, and me

who said that every wish
would be heard and answered
when wished on the morning star
somebody thought of that
and someone believed it
and look what it's done so far
what's so amajing
that keeps us stargajing
and what do we think we might
